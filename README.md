# Skep: Core
Skep is a [CDKTF](https://www.terraform.io/cdktf) library for managing organizations, people, and teams - and the standard infrastructure around them. This module includes the core classes, which are used by plugins and real-life stacks built using Skep.


## What's in a name?
A [skep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beehive#Skeps) is an early manmade beehive, essentially a basket placed upside-down. This project enables organizations to establish a standard structure for teams, then apply that structure across the entire organization as it grows and people move around - not unlike the organization that a beehive brings to the bee colony.
